simple_hbond_calculation.ipynb -- simple example of how to automate calculation of hydrogen bonds using GROMACS

networkx_example.ipynb -- example showing how to use networkx to automate identification of each tail in the CER lipids

advanced_hbond_calculation.ipynb -- example routines breaking up the system spatially and by hairpin/extended CERs and performing automated hydrogen bonding analysis.  Uses elements from the two other notebooks. 

hbonds_by_atom.ipynb -- example routines on how to identify the identify of an hbond

hbonds_by_atom_timeseries.ipynb -- example routines on how to identify the species in an hbond for a timeseries (how to parse matrix file of hbonds)
