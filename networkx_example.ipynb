    "## Goal: Automate the process of identifying which atoms are in each of the two tails of the CERs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examination of each tail separately is necessary to identify if a CER lipid is in a hairpin or extended conformation, and also necessary for identify which leaflet a given tail is in for calculation of various properties on a per-leaflet basis.  While we could simply define a range of indices that correspond to each tail, failure to modify these indices when changing to a different CER type or chain length or in mixtures of CERs would likely lead to errors in the analysis.  \n",
    "* Note, incorrectly identifying the chain indices might not actually cause the analysis code to crash, but simply produce incorrect output (i.e., we probably wouldn't select unallocated memory which would cause the code to seg fault, but instead just access an incorrect location in memory). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal of automated detection, we will utilize `networkx` to create a graph of all connections between carbon atoms and between carbon and hydrogen.  This will essentially create two unconnect subgraphs, since the CERs have a nitrogen in the backbone structure of the headgroup and as such, only including carbon atoms will prevent the two tails from being seen as connected via the headgroup.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure we do not include atoms in the headgroup we can specify that we only consider carbon atoms with local structures ```[C;X4][C][C][H][H]``` or ```[C;X4][C][H][H][H]```(here represented using SMARTS, but it it will just be encoded as if statements below).   \n",

    "* Loop over the first frame in trajectory until we encouter a ucer2\n",
    "    * we will break from the loop after we've operated on the first ucer2 because this is simple for demonstration/testing\n",
    "* create a networkx graph \n",
    "* create a few temporary arrays to store position and element type, as these will be needed for identifying chain indices\n",
    "* populate the graph with all C-C and C-H pairs within a specified distance (i.e., close enough they would be bonded; note bonding information is not included in the mdtraj traj).  \n",
    " * These pairs are added as edges to the graph\n",
    "* Since we hav excluded Nitrogen atoms, we will end up with two non-connected subgraphs in the networkx graph\n",
    "* create a list of indices that match the critera above for each chain\n",
